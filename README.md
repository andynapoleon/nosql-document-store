# NoSQL Document Store Application
The program is like a document store or an online library database where the users search for their favorite articles, add their own papers, or inspect which articles are the most referenced. Built using Python Tkinter and MongoDB.

Run the program on Linux. Simply run "python3 load-json.py" to connect to a MongoDB server, and "python3 main.py" to run the program.
